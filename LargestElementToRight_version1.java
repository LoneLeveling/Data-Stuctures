//Imp note: Time complexity of above code = O(n)

//if you add all push operation then its = pop operations,
//no. of pop's can never be more than the pushe's,
//hence for the while loop you are doing 2n work i., n pushes + n pop's = 2n , basically = O(n) as we ignor econstants.

////EXTRA NOTES:
//
//        ere's the breakdown of time complexity:
//
//        Iterating through the array: O(n)
//
//        The for loop iterates through each element of the input array once.
//        Inside the loop:
//
//        The while loop iterates through elements of the stack, but each element is pushed and popped at most once. Therefore, the total number of operations inside the while loop for all iterations of the outer for loop is bounded by the number of elements in the input array.
//        Other operations inside the loop, such as pushing and popping elements from the stack and assigning values to the ans array, are constant time operations.
//        Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the iteration through the input array, making the time complexity O(n).
